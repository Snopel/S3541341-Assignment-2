This is the GitHub repository for Programming Techniques Assignment 2 Semester 1 2019.

HOW TO USE:
  - View Commits via 'Commits' 
      - In this screen, clicking on the Commit title will show the code.
          - Red means deleted, Green means added.
          - This shows what's been updated and replaced.
      - Pressing the Code icon views repository at that point in time
      - Pressing the Clipboard icon copies the content to your clipboard for use
      
NOTES:
  The initial commit of the Calculator file was just a test. Unfortunately I can't
  find a way to remove it as I'm afraid of removing the whole repository accidentally.
  
INFORMATION:
At every eventful step of the process, a commit and push was made. 
Not only do these commits back up the data in case of emergency, these also allow for the user
to be able to see each individual change, update and addition to the code for reference and
also for knowledge of how the process carried on. This is valuable information as looking
back on past mistakes is just as, if not more, important than succeeding in every step.

At any stage, if needed, a pull request can be made to revert back to that step, or to
gain access to the back up in case the project is lost.
Furthermore, in the case that submission to a forum or (more likely) an Assessment Submission
link, giving the (VERY SPECIFIC) party access to this information can allow them to pull it
and mark it or view it from GitHub instead rather than just assuming the file is completely
lost. 

While GitHub may be an incredible tool for personal use, it is also a great career step
as this website is widely used by even the highest end industries. If an employer asks
about GitHub and no knowledge is shown, you are already far behind everyone else.
